## Warning

Plakar is currently **NOT** production ready yet but it is most definitely stable enough to be tested by others.

Feel free to give it a try, give feedback on what you like/dislike and report bugs.

Be aware that at this point you may still face some bugs and you may need to rebuild your backups from scratch every now and then as we bring improvements to the storage format.
